# vue-todo

> This is my first Vue project to see if I can learn the basics of the framework.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

This was built on top of the official Vue documentation and the ToDo app example featured in the framework's website.
